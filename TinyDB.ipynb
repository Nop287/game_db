The 'thunderstick' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy's chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features. \\n \\nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it's plans hasn't fully been implemented. \\n \\nMany choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives.\",\n",

Several companions will join the player during his quest, and will, depending on the player\\\\u0027s actions, develop friendship, romance or rivalry. Also, using the crafting, you can customize your weapons and armour with more depth than most other games. for example, you can change the blade and hilt of your sword separately, which not only changes its appearance, but will also change its attributes e.g., + 4 crit, + 3 speed. When fighting enemies, you can use three different fighting styles: one uses slow, heavy, damaging strikes with weapons like axes and hammers, and a push/ kick ability to interrupt enemies or break their defences; another uses small weapons like daggers for quick strikes, and gives you a dodge ability to evade enemy attacks. The third style uses fire attacks for big damage, and can be combined with the other two fighting styles to do things like enhancing weapons with fire damage. Each of the three styles has its own skill tree with both passive and active abilities. During combat, you can use other attacks aside from striking with your weapon, like a crossbow, traps, and abilities you\\\\u0027ve earned from the skill trees.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1,\\n      17\\n    ],\\n    \"total_rating\": 60.65101465587105,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 38,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/bound-by-flame\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 11816,\\n    \"genres\": [\\n      31,\\n      34\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World\",\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      6,\\n      46,\\n      48,\\n      130\\n    ],\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      156079,\\n      156080,\\n      173594,\\n      173595,\\n      173596,\\n      173597,\\n      176576\\n    ],\\n    \"summary\": \"YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World is an upcoming remake of a Japanese visual novel of the same title.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. \\\\n \\\\nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \\\\\"Butterfly Effect\\\\\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player\\\\u0027s choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \\\\\"hundreds of endings\\\\\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. \\\\n \\\\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. \\\\n \\\\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      19,\\n      21\\n    ],\\n    \"total_rating\": 80.37634174385855,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 390,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/until-dawn\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 129884,\\n    \"artworks\": [\\n      8573,\\n      8574\\n    ],\\n    \"genres\": [\\n      5,\\n      12,\\n      24,\\n      31\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"Destiny 2: Shadowkeep - Season of Dawn\",\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      6,\\n      48,\\n      49\\n    ],\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      188800,\\n      188801,\\n      188802\\n    ],\\n    \"summary\": \"Journey through time to save a legendary hero.

It’s your job to lead them… or fall. \\n \\nEnthralling, Choice-driven Narrative – You’re not just deciding who to send into which battle in Inquisition, you’re making important decisions that shape the future of Thedas. Each choice carries weight, and your actions can lead to a variety of outcomes. Inquisition is a highly personalized journey, where one wrong move could set in motion a series of events that alter the physical aspects of the world itself, making your Thedas – and your heroes – feel truly unique. \\n \\nA Massive World to Discover – The world of Thedas has never been bigger or more detailed; it’s wide open, and ripe for exploration. Discover enemy keeps ripe for the taking. Unearth hidden caves filled with lurking creatures. Thedas is vast and dangerous, but uncovering its secrets can spell the difference between victory and defeat. \\n \\nIntense, Strategic Combat – There’s no wrong way to play Dragon Age: Inquisition… except for the way that gets you killed. Fortunately, the optional strategic view gives you a god’s-eye vantage on battle.

Their peaceful days enjoying life as a family came to an abrupt end when Dr. Fetus beat the snot out of them with a rusty shovel, and kidnapped Nugget! Now it’s up to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl to rescue their daughter from a lunatic fetus in a jar that can only be described as an incel version of Tony Stark. \\\\n \\\\n- Super Meat Boy Forever is the sequel to Super Meat Boy! This is a new experience that eclipses the original. Don’t stare directly at it unless you still have your eclipse glasses. \\\\n- 7200 individually handcrafted levels combine dynamically to give you a new challenge every single time you play. Seven thousand two hundred levels. They said we couldn’t do it, but we did. Who’s they? Don’t ask. They don’t like it when you ask. \\\\n- It’s hard, but fair. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. Just ask Dark Soulman. \\\\n- Meat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris. \\\\n- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this. \\\\n- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.) \\\\n- A soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness. \\\\n- Frame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions. \\\\n- A story so rich and moving that it makes Citizen Kane look like an unboxing video for a dehumidifier.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1\\n    ],\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-meat-boy-forever\"\\n  }\\n]',\n",

The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1,\\n      19,\\n      21,\\n      31\\n    ],\\n    \"total_rating\": 80.84641328948075,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 474,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-walking-dead-season-two\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 127058,\\n    \"genres\": [\\n      2,\\n      31\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 2: A House Divided\",\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      6,\\n      9,\\n      12,\\n      14,\\n      39,\\n      46,\\n      48,\\n      49,\\n      130\\n    ],\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      181904,\\n      181905,\\n      181906,\\n      181907,\\n      181908,\\n      181909,\\n      181910,\\n      181911,\\n      181912,\\n      181913,\\n      181914,\\n      181915,\\n      181916\\n    ],\\n    \"summary\": \"After gaining new friends (and enemies), Clementine has found her way into the lives of more survivors.

       "  'summary': 'Similar to the previous season, The Walking Dead: Season Two is a point-and-click adventure game. The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers.',\n",

Both stealth and skill are required to defeat enemy squads in a brutal game of cat and mouse.

Several companions will join the player during his quest, and will, depending on the player\\\\u0027s actions, develop friendship, romance or rivalry. Also, using the crafting, you can customize your weapons and armour with more depth than most other games. for example, you can change the blade and hilt of your sword separately, which not only changes its appearance, but will also change its attributes e.g., + 4 crit, + 3 speed. When fighting enemies, you can use three different fighting styles: one uses slow, heavy, damaging strikes with weapons like axes and hammers, and a push/ kick ability to interrupt enemies or break their defences; another uses small weapons like daggers for quick strikes, and gives you a dodge ability to evade enemy attacks. The third style uses fire attacks for big damage, and can be combined with the other two fighting styles to do things like enhancing weapons with fire damage. Each of the three styles has its own skill tree with both passive and active abilities. During combat, you can use other attacks aside from striking with your weapon, like a crossbow, traps, and abilities you\\\\u0027ve earned from the skill trees.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1,\\n      17\\n    ],\\n    \"total_rating\": 60.65101465587105,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 38,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/bound-by-flame\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 104008,\\n    \"genres\": [\\n      31\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"Candle: The Power of the Flame\",\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      48,\\n      49,\\n      130\\n    ],\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      156064,\\n      156065,\\n      156066\\n    ],\\n    \"summary\": \"Candle: The Power of the Flame’s visuals are presented as beautiful hand-drawn watercolour images - all the layered backgrounds, characters and objects have been individually painted and scanned into the game.

Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well and that the GameCube\\\\u0027s capabilities could bring the game closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics were vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game. \\\\n \\\\nUpon release, Resident Evil received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its graphics and improved gameplay over the original game. It is often described as one of the best, scariest, and most visually impressive entries in the Resident Evil series. Despite this, the game sold worse than expected and led Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action-oriented approach. In 2008, the game was ported to the Wii, featuring a new control system.

Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other\\'s names. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air.\\n\\nThe developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player\\'s actions, building a single theme to represent the game\\'s emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience. Journey won several \"game of the year\" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards.',\n",

The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization. \\\\n \\\\nFitted with an advanced CREO exo-suit, balancing your core power against your implants and exo-suit upgrades will allow you to specialize in a huge variety of combat styles, thanks to the almost limitless combinations of addons and dozens of make-shift weapons salvaged from the industrial complex. Finely tune your gear to match your playstyle, and to best suit the challenge ahead. The Metroidvanian levels open up as your core power increases, allowing you to over-charge doors previously too strong for your suit to damage and opening new pathways for you to explore. The CREO facility is vast, and if you want to find and craft the best equipment and weapons, you will need to search every area for secrets and hidden items. \\\\n \\\\nThe Surge features innovative combat mechanics, allowing you to target individual limbs and dismember the exo-suit add-on or weapon you want to acquire. Collecting tech-scrap and blueprints, you will be able to return to the Operation Center to level up and craft new exo-suit addons and weapons salvaged throughout the level.

The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization. \\n \\nFitted with an advanced CREO exo-suit, balancing your core power against your implants and exo-suit upgrades will allow you to specialize in a huge variety of combat styles, thanks to the almost limitless combinations of addons and dozens of make-shift weapons salvaged from the industrial complex. Finely tune your gear to match your playstyle, and to best suit the challenge ahead. The Metroidvanian levels open up as your core power increases, allowing you to over-charge doors previously too strong for your suit to damage and opening new pathways for you to explore. The CREO facility is vast, and if you want to find and craft the best equipment and weapons, you will need to search every area for secrets and hidden items. \\n \\nThe Surge features innovative combat mechanics, allowing you to target individual limbs and dismember the exo-suit add-on or weapon you want to acquire. Collecting tech-scrap and blueprints, you will be able to return to the Operation Center to level up and craft new exo-suit addons and weapons salvaged throughout the level. The most powerful of these can be acquired from the world’s gigantic, industrial bosses. Most of what you encounter in The Surge was never originally designed to kill you, and most of the items you loot and craft were never meant for combat. However, the combined strength of the exo-suit and near-future technology of CREO mean that anything from fork-lifting addons to laser cutters can be used as lethal weapons for diving deeper into the facility.',\n",

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you. \\\\n \\\\nHITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st. \\\\n \\\\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode. \\\\n \\\\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return. \\\\n \\\\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements.

Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you. \\n \\nHITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st. \\n \\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode. \\n \\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return. \\n \\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic. \\n \\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.',\n",

A technique dubbed \"expressive communication\" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair. \\n \\n \\nWild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons & a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.',\n",

In the critically acclaimed Tomb Raider, Lara Croft was forged into a true survivor, but she glimpsed a deeper, secret world. \\\\n \\\\nNow, after uncovering an ancient mystery, Lara must explore the most treacherous and remote regions of Siberia to find the secret of immortality before a ruthless organization known as Trinity. Lara must use her wits and survival skills, form new alliances, and ultimately embrace her destiny as the Tomb Raider. Experience high-octane action moments, conquer beautifully hostile environments, engage in brutal guerilla combat, and explore awe-inspiring deadly tombs in the evolution of survival action. In “Rise of the Tomb Raider,” Lara becomes more than a survivor as she embarks on her first Tomb Raiding expedition. PlayStation VR Support: The full “Blood Ties” story chapter can be experienced in PlayStation VR, and players choose between two control schemes. “Comfort Mode” allows players to teleport from point to point, completely eliminating any potential discomfort. Meanwhile, experienced VR users can select “Free Mode” to move and look around using the thumb sticks. \\\\n \\\\nManipulate HD relics, examine documents, and control the flashlight with the Sixaxis controller motion as you unlock the mystery of Lara’s childhood home in first-person. The immersive HD beauty of Croft Manor is perfectly suited to VR, and for the first time in franchise history, players can explore the world through Lara’s eyes.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1,\\n      21,\\n      23\\n    ],\\n    \"total_rating\": 86.70737618864,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 58,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 42916,\\n    \"genres\": [\\n      5,\\n      31\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration Collector\\\\u0027s Edition\",\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      48\\n    ],\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      89805\\n    ],\\n    \"summary\": \"Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration includes the critically acclaimed Rise of the Tomb Raider, nominated for over 75 \\\\\"Best Of\\\\\" awards, in which Lara Croft becomes more than a survivor as she embarks on her first Tomb Raiding expedition to the most treacherous and remote regions of Siberia.\",\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1,\\n      21,\\n      23\\n    ],\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-collectors-edition\"\\n  }\\n]',\n",
