<h1>Sharing Data Between Components</h1>

<!-- 
In this file we define two componets, one for input and one for output.
We also have a vue.js app. The goal is to share one variabe between all 
three elements. It has to be reative, so that we can change it using our
input component.

This will be extended for the output to deliver a result list from a REST
call dynamically given the input parameters. 
-->

<div id="app">
  <!-- ratingApp is the variable to share. -->
  <!-- This just displays the variable, but is already reactive. -->
  <p>This is the rating on the App level: {{ ratingApp }}</p>
  <!-- This component will be extended to display results of a REST call. -->
  <!-- In v-bind we have to use kabab case as HTML attributes are case-insensitive. vue.js gives a warning. -->
  <rating-output v-bind:rating-comp2="ratingApp"></rating-output>	
  <!-- This is the input component. We will need two for minimum and maximum rating. -->
  <rating-input v-model="ratingApp" v-on:input="ratingApp = $event" type="number"></rating-input>
</div>

<script>

/*
This is the input component. To use it together with v-model the variable has to be named "value".
This is explained very well here: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Using-v-model-on-Components
It will emit an event called "input" with the value entered. 
*/
Vue.component('rating-input', {
  props: ["value"],
  template: `
    <input
      v-bind:value="value"
      v-on:input="$emit('input', $event.target.value)"
    >
  `
})

/*
This is a very simple output component. Later it will be more elaborate. 
For now we just want to check the correct bindings.
*/
Vue.component('rating-output', {
  props: ["ratingComp2"],
  template: `
    <p>Minimal Rating: {{ ratingComp2 }}</p>
  `
})

/*
This is the vue app. The only relevant thing is that we define the global variable ratingApp
for everything to be reactive. The components will bind to this variable.
*/
var app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    ratingApp: 42
  }
