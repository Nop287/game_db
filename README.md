# Building a Computer Game Database

The idea is to build a computer game data base. This starts with getting data from the internet based on the name and platform of a game.
Then we need a backend serving the data over a REST API. Finally we will have a frontend running in a browser.

This is currently a work in progress. The following files are relevant:
